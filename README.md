# Build Instructions

## 1. Building for Ubuntu desktop

### Requirements

 - Ubuntu 16.04 or later
 - Environment created using dali_env script in dali-core repository
 - GCC version 6

DALi requires a compiler supporting C++11 features.
Ubuntu 16.04 is the first version to offer this by default (GCC v5.4.0).

GCC version 6 is recommended since it has fixes for issues in version 5
e.g. it avoids spurious 'defined but not used' warnings in header files.

### Building the Repository

To build the repository enter the 'build/tizen' folder:

         $ cd dali-demo/build/tizen

Then run the following commands:

         $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$DESKTOP_PREFIX .
         $ make install -j8

### DEBUG Builds

Specify a debug build when building for desktop by passing the following parameter to cmake:

         $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$DESKTOP_PREFIX -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .

Before running make install as normal:

         $ make install -j8

## 2. GBS Builds

### NON-SMACK Targets

         $ gbs build -A [TARGET_ARCH]

### SMACK enabled Targets

         $ gbs build -A [TARGET_ARCH] --define "%enable_dali_smack_rules 1"

### DEBUG Builds

         $ gbs build -A [TARGET_ARCH] --define "%enable_debug 1"

# Creating an example

 - Make a directory in the "examples" directory. Only one example will be created per directory.
 - The executable installed will have a ".example" appended to it, e.g. a "blocks" directory produces "blocks.example".
 - Add all source files for the required example in this directory.
 - Modify "com.samsung.dali-demo.xml" to include your example so that it can be launched on target.
 - No changes are required to the make system as long as the above is followed, your example will be automatically built & installed.

## 3. Building for Android

### Requirements

 - Ubuntu 16.04 or later
 - GCC version 6

### Building the Repository

To build the repository enter the 'build/android' folder:

         $ cd dali-demo/build/android

Then run the following command:

         $ ./build.sh

For debug build:

         $ DEBUG=1 ./build.sh

To clean the build:

         $ ./build.sh clean

To install apks:

         $ adb install -r ./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/dali-demo-debug.apk
         $ adb install -r ./app/build/outputs/apk/release/dali-demo-release.apk
